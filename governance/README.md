# .NET Foundation Governance

The .NET Foundation prefers a lightweight approach when it comes to project governance. Each 
project in the .NET Foundation is largely able to decide how they wish to work and what governance
model is most appropriate to them. However we do put some basic structure in place to 
ensure good practices from the projects in the foundation and a certain minimum set of
process.

 - [.NET Foundation Structure](foundation-structure.md)
 - [Articles of Incorporation](http://dotnetfoundation.org/Media/Default/Documents/NET%20Foundation%20Articles%20of%20Incorporation.pdf) 
 - [By-laws](http://dotnetfoundation.org/Media/Default/Documents/.NET%20Foundation-First-Amended-and-Restated-Bylaws-2015-03-25.pdf)
 - [Project Governance Models](project-governance.md)
   - Releasable vs non-releaseable materials
   - Project Roles
   - Decision Making 
 - [Contribution License Agreement](https://cla2.dotnetfoundation.org/)
 - [Code of Conduct](../blob/master/guidance/be-nice.md)
 
In addition, once a project is accepted into the .NET Foundation, any decision affecting the
license applied to the project must recieve approval from the .NET Foundation Board of Directors.
