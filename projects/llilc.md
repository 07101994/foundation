# LLILC

LLILC (pronounced 'lilac') is an **LL**VM based MS**IL C**ompiler with a goal of producing a set of cross-platform .NET code generation tools. Today LLILC is being developed against [dotnet/CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr) for use as a JIT, but an ahead of time (AOT) compiler is planned for the future.
