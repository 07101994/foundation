# Mono

Mono, the open source development platform based on the .NET Framework, allows developers to build cross-platform applications with improved developer productivity. Mono’s .NET implementation is based on the ECMA standards for [C#](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm) and the [Common Language Infrastructure](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm).

Supported previously by Novell, [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/) and now [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) and the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/), the Mono project has an active and enthusiastic contributing community. Mono includes both developer tools and the infrastructure needed to run .NET client and server applications.

## The Components

There are several components that make up Mono:

* **C# Compiler** - Mono’s C# compiler is feature complete for C# 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 (ECMA). A good description of the feature of the various versions is available on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29#Versions).
* **Mono Runtime** - The runtime implements the ECMA Common Language Infrastructure (CLI). The runtime provides a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler, an Ahead-of-Time compiler (AOT), a library loader, the garbage collector, a threading system and interoperability functionality.
* **.NET Framework Class Library** - The Mono platform provides a comprehensive set of classes that provide a solid foundation to build applications on. These classes are compatible with Microsoft’s .Net Framework classes.
* **Mono Class Library** - Mono also provides many classes that go above and beyond the Base Class Library provided by Microsoft. These provide additional functionality that are useful, especially in building Linux applications. Some examples are classes for Gtk+, Zip files, LDAP, OpenGL, Cairo, POSIX, etc.
